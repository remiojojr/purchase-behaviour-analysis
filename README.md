# purchase-behaviour-analysis

Coke has an opportunity to segment their market with information obtained from POS systems and Environics data to increase sales by bringing products closer to consumers that are certain to buy their products. The opportunity was to fine-tune marketing techniques to increase unit sales by intelligent product-to-shelf placements to optimize allocations for retailers. So a hierarchical clustering algorithm was applied to place products into a BCG product matrix (Stars, Cash cows, etc.). Then using demographic data, we were able to determine the key characteristics of their question mark products and determined that the best outcome would be to see an increase in the unit sales in their retail partners and gain an increasing share of wallet with the question mark products. Measuring the results from the segmentation analysis and retailer product offering strategies, it was expected to see an increase in revenue lift, market share, and the ability to identify consumer purchase behaviour.
